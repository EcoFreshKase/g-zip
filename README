A programm to convert binary files to DNA sequences, encode them with error correcting codes, customize the FASTA-Header and decode DNA sequences back to binary data.

This program was initially made as a school project. Therefore some comments maybe even most are in german. This will be changed over time.
Error Correcting and FASTA-Header customization are not yet implemented.
